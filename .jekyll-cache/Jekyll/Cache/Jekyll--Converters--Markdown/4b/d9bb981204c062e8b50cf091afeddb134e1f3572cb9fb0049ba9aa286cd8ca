<p><em>Abstract:</em></p>
<div style="text-align:justify"> This paper studies the aggregate dynamic effects of uncertainty about fiscal policy shocks on a Two-Agent New Keynesian (TANK) model. We reinforce real consequences that uncertainty shocks can have on the economy, indicating that these can be bigger than those caused by fiscal policy decisions. Also, we highlight indirect channels through which uncertainty can affect both constraint and unconstrained households without further changes on aggregate responses. We extend or analysis to a developing country, comparing results for the US with Brazil, which demonstrates the consistency of the mechanism, with distinct effects only for consumption. At the same time, we observe a strong distinction results depending on the direct reaction of the monetary authority to volatility shocks. Results in this paper demonstrate that a TANK model is able to account for aggregate results of a heterogeneous agent New Keynesian model, where fiscal policy uncertainty resembles income risk shocks.</div>
